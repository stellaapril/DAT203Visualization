# Phase 1
## 1.	Project title
> Improving English Vocabulary in Different Ways

## 2.	Core inquiry questions you're pursuing
Which way is the most efficient way to improve English vocabulary?

## 3.	Rationale for project: what motivates you to engage with this subject so deeply? What is at stake?
> As a foreigner using English as a daily language in last 3 years, I realized that vocabulary is one of the most important parts in a language more and more clearly. Vocabulary involves in our reading comprehension, communication, expression, and our study and career. There are many different ways to improve vocabulary. To explore key variables related to improve vocabulary, I will compare three popular ways of learning vocabulary through data analysis. 

## 4.	Create a written description of what you hypothesize you might uncover in your data-drive inquiry and why. What uncertainties remain?
> I record data about spending time, remember rate, and level of interest. However, in this hypothesize it might uncover the personal study status such as sleep hours, health status. In addition, study environments is a factor might affect the remember rate and time. Furthermore, the difficult level of vocabulary is a factor affect the remember rate and time.

## 5.	Create a cause-outcome relationship diagram underpinning your systems of investigation: Which actions, forces, or events trigger or influence what key outcomes of interest?

## 6.	As a result of your cause-effect diagramming, identify which one or two variables you hope to track will be of most interest to your analysis
I will track the study time spending on each ways which learn 10 new words per day, and the remember rate in the later days. 
## 7.	Generate TWO or THREE sample visualizations which display the value of your variables of interest over some time period--probably the length of our study, which is about a month and a half. NOTE: you'll want to study and complete phase 2, tool building to be most thorough at creating a sample visualization using your planning from that phase.
